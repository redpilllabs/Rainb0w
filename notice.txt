This script will deploy VLESS and Hysteria2 proxies using Sing-Box 
and it requires the following in order to proceed:

1. A Cloudflare account

2. A Cloudflare API key that has permission to modify DNS zones (Refer to repo wiki for tutorials)

3. A domain name added to your Cloudflare account with 2 subdomains with 'A' records pointed to your origin server:

    (A). A subdomain to use for protocols that require a direct connection
        to your server such as [Hysteria]

    (B). A subdomain to use for protocols that are compatible with CDNs
        such as [Websocket, HTTPUpgrade, gRPC], using this setup you can turn on CDN routing
        for these protocols when your IP is blocked without affecting your other proxies and
        without requiring any change on the client side.

        NOTE: CDN proxy MUST BE OFF while deploying! You can turn it on after finishing the setup.
